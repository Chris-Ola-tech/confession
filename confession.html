      we have been friends for 3 years now and honestly u av become one of d most important people in my life. 
      u have seen me at my best, my worst and everything in between and through it all u av been there. dats something i dont take lightly. 
      there is something i av been holding back all this time, but since i will probably be leaving soon, i dont want to hide it anymore.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      d truth is... i av fallen for u. i really do love you dara. not just as my best friend, but as someone i could genuinely see myself with. u r d kind of person i want to build something real with -
       not just something casual dat fades away or something we rush into without thinking. i av thought about this for a long time, and i didnt want to say anything unless i was sure. and now i am.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      but am also being honest with myself. ryt now, am not ready to give a relationship what it deserves. i want to be financially stable, focused, and in a position where i can actually show up for u d way u deserve. i dont want us to start something now and have it fall apart bcus of things dat could av been avoided  stress, distractions, or me not being able to give u my best. so am not asking u to date me right now or asking u to wait for me while i figure things out.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      but wat am asking for is honesty. i need to know how u feel about me too. not bcus am trying to pressure u, but bcus i need to know where i stand in ur heart. if u feel d same way, even a little, dat would mean everything to me and maybe wen we're both ready and d timing is right, we can see where it goes. but if u dont feel d same way, i need to know dat too so i can respect it and start moving on. i dont want to spend years wondering "what if" or holding onto something dat was never meant to be.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      u deserve to know where my heart is, and i deserve to know where i stand with u. not so i can rush u into anything, but so we both have clarity and can move forward honestly  whether dats together someday or as friends who respect each other enough to b real.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      and even if u dont feel d same way, or if life takes u somewhere else and u find someone who makes u happy, i will still respect u. it wont change d fact dat u av been my best friend and dat i will always b here for u, in whatever way u will av me. I just needed you to know this because keeping it hidden feels unfair to myself and to how much you mean to me. ‚ù§Ô∏è
