      we have been friends for 3 years now and honestly u av become one of d most important people in my life. 
      u have seen me at my best, my worst and everything in between and through it all u av been there. dats something i dont take lightly. 
      there is something i av been holding back all this time, but since i will probably be leaving soon, i dont want to hide it anymore.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      d truth is ..... i av fallen for u .i really do love you Dara. not in a casual way,not in a passing 'crush' way, but in a way dat makes me think about the long term. u r d kind of person i'd want beside me not just for a year or two, but for life. dats y i havent rushed to say ds earlier bcus i dont want something short with u. i dont want us to date just for a few months and risk everything we av built as bsf.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      i want something real and lasting, something we can both grow into without fear. ryt now, i dont feel lyk d timing is perfect. i want to be financially stable, focused, and ready to give u my best without us falling apart over things dat could av been avoided. so am not asking for an answer ryt now.am not even saying let's date today. wat am saying is i love you,i value u and i want a long lasting future with u wen d time is right.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      if u ever feel d same way, dat would mean d world to me. and even if u dont, or even if u choose someone else before dat time comes, i will still respect u. it wont change d fact dat u av been my bsf and dat i will always b here for u, in whatever way u will av me. I just needed you to know this because keeping it hidden feels unfair to myself and to how much you mean to me. ‚ù§Ô∏è.
