      We have been friends for three years now and honestly you have become one of the most important people in my life.
You have seen me at my best my worst and everything in between and through it all you have been there. That is something I do not take lightly.
There is something I have been holding back all this time but since I will probably be leaving soon I do not want to hide it anymore.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      The truth is, I have fallen for you. I really do love you Dara. Not just as my best friend, but as someone I could genuinely see myself with. You are the kind of person I want to build something real with, not just something casual that fades away or something we rush into without thinking. I have thought about this for a long time, and I did not want to say anything unless I was sure. And now I am.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      But I am also being honest with myself. Right now I am not ready to give a relationship what it deserves. I want to be financially stable, focused, and in a position where I can actually show up for you the way you deserve. I do not want us to start something now and have it fall apart because of things that could have been avoided, stress, distractions, or me not being able to give you my best. So I am not asking you to date me right now or to wait for me while I figure things out.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      But what I am asking for is honesty. I need to know how you feel about me too. Not because I am trying to pressure you, but because I need to know where I stand in your heart. If you feel the same way, even a little, that would mean everything to me, and maybe when we are both ready and the timing is right, we can see where it goes. But if you do not feel the same way, I need to know that too so I can respect it and start moving on. I do not want to spend years wondering ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù or holding onto something that was never meant to be.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      You deserve to know where my heart is, and I deserve to know where I stand with you. Not so I can rush you into anything, but so we both have clarity and can move forward honestly, whether that is together someday or as friends who respect each other enough to be real.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-white hidden-line">
      And even if you do not feel the same way, or if life takes you somewhere else and you find someone who makes you happy, I will still respect you. It will not change the fact that you have been my best friend and that I will always be here for you, in whatever way you will have me. I just needed you to know this because keeping it hidden feels unfair to myself and to how much you mean to me. ‚ù§Ô∏è
